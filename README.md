# ATC Test

Common tools for writing tests using XUnit, AutoFixture, NSubstitute and FluentAssertions.

> **Version Notes:**  
> If you are using the `MemberAutoNSubstituteData` attribute, ensure that both `xunit` and `xunit.extensibility.core` packages are set to version **2.9.0**.
> This is because the latest versions of xUnit are currently incompatible with `MemberAutoNSubstituteData` due to an unresolved issue. Although [xunit/xunit#3031](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3031) has been closed, the problem remains unresolved.  
> Upgrading beyond version 2.9.0 may result in test failures or unexpected behavior.


## Test Attributes

| Name | Description |
|-|-|
| `AutoNSubstituteData` | Provides auto-generated data specimens generated by AutoFixture and NSubstitute as an extension to XUnit's [Theory] attribute.|
| `InlineAutoNSubstituteData` | Provides a data source for a data theory, with the data coming from inline values combined with auto-generated data specimens generated by AutoFixture and NSubstitute.|
| `MemberAutoNSubstituteData` | Provides a data source for a data theory, with the data coming from one of the following sources and combined with auto-generated data specimens generated by AutoFixture and NSubstitute.|

> **Note:**
> NSubstitute is used when the type being created is abstract, or when the `[Substitute]` is applied.

## Test Helpers

| Name | Description |
|-|-|
| `EquivalencyAssertionOptionsExtensions` | Extensions for FluentAssertions to compare dates with a precision when using `.BeEquivalentTo()`.|
| `FixtureFactory` | Static factory for creating AutoFixture `Fixture` instances.|
| `ObjectExtensions` | Extensions calling protected members on an object.|
| `SubstituteExtensions` | Extensions for NSubstitutes to wait for calls and get arguments of a received call.|
| `TaskExtensions` | Extensions for Tasks to add timeouts when awaiting. |

## Extensibility

The default `Fixture` returned by the `FixtrueFactory.Create()` method is used for all the `Attributes` mentioned above.

To add customizations to this, you can add the `AutoRegisterAttribute` to any custom `ICustomization` or `ISpecimenBuilder` to have it automatically added to the Fixture.

See [`CancellationTokenGenerator`](src/Atc.Test/Customizations/Generators/CancellationTokenGenerator.cs) for an example on how to do this.
